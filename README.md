# The MAGSAC algorithm for robust model fitting without using an inlier-outlier threshold

The MAGSAC and MAGSAC++ algorithms proposed for robust model estimation without a single inlier-outlier threshold.

Made in OpenCV 3.46.
To run the executable with the examples, copy the "data" folder next to the executable or set the path in the main() function.

# Installation

To build and install `MAGSAC`, clone or download this repository and, also, the sub-modules. Then build the project by CMAKE. 

# Example project

To build the sample project showing examples of fundamental matrix, homography and essential matrix fitting, set variable `CREATE_SAMPLE_PROJECT = ON` when creating the project in CMAKE. 

Next to the executable, copy the `data` folder and, also, create a `results` folder. 

# Requirements

- Eigen 3.0 or higher
- CMake 2.8.12 or higher
- OpenCV 3.0 or higher
- A modern compiler with C++17 support

# Python wrapper

The Python wrapper for MAGSAC can be found at https://github.com/ducha-aiki/pymagsac thanks to Dmytro Mishkin.
